# Session 11: Assignment 2

In this assignment students have to compress racoon grey scale image into 5 clusters. In
the end, visualize both raw and compressed image and look for quality difference.
The raw image is available in spicy.misc package with the name face.

Hint:

import numpy as np
from sklearn import cluster, datasets
from scipy import misc

import time
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.misc import face
from sklearn.feature_extraction import image
from sklearn.cluster import spectral_clustering
from skimage.transform import resize


beta = 5
#taking cluster as 5
clusters_no = 5
eps = 1e-6

#taking gray scale
face = face(gray=True)
face = resize(face, (face.shape[0] /8, face.shape[1] /8))

graph = image.img_to_graph(face)
graph.data = np.exp(-beta * graph.data / graph.data.std()) + eps

plt.gray()
plt.imshow(face)
plt.show()

for assign_labels in ('kmeans', 'discretize'):
    t0 = time.time()
    labels = spectral_clustering(graph, n_clusters=no_of_clusters,
                                 assign_labels=assign_labels, random_state=1)
    t1 = time.time()
    labels = labels.reshape(face.shape)

    plt.figure(figsize=(5, 5))
    plt.imshow(face, cmap=plt.cm.gray)
    for l in range(no_of_clusters):
        plt.contour(labels == l)
    plt.xticks(())
    plt.yticks(())
    title = 'Spectral clustering: %s, %.2fs' % (assign_labels, (t1 - t0))
    print(title)
    plt.title(title)
plt.show()
